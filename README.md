# Heart-Disease-Prediction
I made this heart disease prediction project using various algorithm in machine learning.
Under this Project I have worked on the project of Heart disease prediction using Logistic Regression in
Machine Learning. I performed various analysis on dataset like exploratory data analysis, checking correlation 
building a predictive system etc. and got the accuracy of 85.6% on training data and accuracy of 82.5% on 
testing data.
